This repo contains **Playwright tests in TypeScript** with Testomat.io plugins

# Installation

This is a playground for your first steps in testing, so instead of installing it from NPM it is recommended to clone it from repo instead.

1) Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:testomatio/examples.git && cd examples/playwright
```

2) Install dependencies via npm:

```
npm i
```

2.1) Run tests to check if they work (via npm):

```
npm run test:e2e-examples
```

This will install Playwright with puppeteer & Testomat.io reporter

## Loading Tests to Testomat.io

1. Create empty project in Testomat.io
2. Obtain API key from Testomat.io
2. Run `npx check-tests` to upload tests data into testomat.io. Pass api key as `TESTOMATIO` environment variable:

```
TESTOMATIO={apiKey} npx check-tests playwright --typescript "**/*{.,_}spec.ts"
```

> **Environment variables** It is recommended to store Testomatio API Key as environment variable and never save it in the source code. Set them directly when running tests or use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to save environment variable in a file and load them for tests.

## Publishing Test Results to Testomat.io

Get API key from a project in Testomat.io and set it as environment variable `TESTOMATIO`:

```
TESTOMATIO={apiKey} npx playwright tests
```

### Configuration

Testomatio repoter is enabled in `playwright.config.ts`:

```js
reporter: [
  ['list'],
  ['@testomatio/reporter/lib/adapter/playwright.js', {
    apiKey: process.env.TESTOMATIO,
  }]
],
```
